# LangChain SemanticSimilarityLengthBasedExampleSelector
LangChain.js offers a SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector and a LengthBasedExampleSelector, however what if you need both? This package solves that issue by combining both selectors into the SemanticSimilarityLengthBasedExampleSelector.

```

### Test the package

You can test the code with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Check dependencies

You can check and upgrade dependencies to the latest versions, ignoring specified versions. with [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates):
